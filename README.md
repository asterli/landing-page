# landing-page

This project's purpose is for practicing HTML, CSS, and tools in flexbox. This is a project assigned by the non-profit organization "The Odin Project." Here, I will test my knowledge of HTML/CSS to create a web page from scratch and make it look as close as possible to the photo named odin-project-sample-webpage.png
